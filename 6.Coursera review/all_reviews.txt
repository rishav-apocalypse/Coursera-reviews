I came to this specialization from Andrew's twitter post, wanted to give it a try since Andrew's DL specialization is very good. However, this course is not taught by Andrew, and the video lectures sound like the instructor is just reading the script, not really inspiring me to follow the lecture since the videos are very dry.

The course is interesting, and it is built carefully in all the aspects (videos and code), even though I followed it in their first days of live. 

 

Grading process is more on programing than on understanding NLP (classification and vector spaces). For instance; Slight changes in the code (spaces, repeated codes of questions identification, lack of use of the proposed functions...) derive on fail to pass. Error information are frequently uninformative. It is not possible to check part of the code (see W4) 

 

The use of "Slack" is not proper; information it is not easily accessible, unorganized and it demands on students the learning of new tools and additional payments. 

 

Definitively I used more time with the code than with the NLP content

Hopefully this comment is useful for students and teachers. 

 

Thanks a lot

This course has too many problems as it stands:

1) They haven't chosen an audience: the concept that they explain are trivial for anyone having (even basic) machine learning (or even basic linear algebra) knowledge. However, it doesn't meant that this explanations would be useful for beginners: they are too short and incomplete (the "videos" are on average 3 minutes long!!) and what they focus on is often not the most relevant part.

2) There is no reading material: no books, no papers, no theory. It wouldn't be a problem if the videos themselves were decent, but most of them are about 1 minute long. You can't explain machine learning in such a short time. 

3) The code of the assignments, especially assignment 4, is unclean (e.g. unused variables) and contains minor bugs. 

4) The script that grades the assignments has very strict requirements: as an example, very often, if you use x.dot(A) instead of np(x,A), then it complains and says you've failed. This happens for a lot of numpy functions, and it makes the process of submitting results tedious.

5) Again, regarding the course material itself, many of the key aspects are not discussed. For example, word embeddings are given that have some nice properties, but its never explained how they have been obtained.

Overall, it seems completely rushed.

Quiet good starting course for those who decided to study NLP. Materials are qualitative, but also too short.  The course lacks of depth, lectures are too simple, hence in order to deepen knowledge and understanding one have to read a lot of additional resources, which are not provided here. I have  ambiguous impressions about this course. Seems, the best DeepLearning.ai courses are those taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. 

To sum up, I think, lectures duration should be increased and more deep intuition should be provided. Programming assignments are peace of cake for experienced programmer, but are OK for beginners. Also, there are many incomprehensible mistakes in programming tasks, which I suppose will be fixed later. Nevertheless, I recommend this course for those who want to start a journey to NLP world.

Pros: Good amount of subject coverage and many tips and useful demo notebooks.

Cons: Sometimes it feels like one has to guess sometimes what they grader wants in the exercise at other times it feels like spoon-feeding. There can be better balance and error output explanations. More test cases for the assignments are needed to verify intermediate function outputs. Also, sometimes the course instructor mentions that you do not have to understand this concept or you can easily look it up online. This is not very encouraging because of course, one can look things up on the internet. It would be better suited to explain things however briefly it may be. Cue from Andrew's course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", Andrew always explains the things even if it is brief and always gives you the intuition behind things. 

All in all, recommended course to get started.

General Comments on Course 1All of the linguistic and semantic knowledge that we were mining in Course 1 was encoded in the vectors.  The coding was just using statistical methods to draw linguistic inferences from these vectors.  I find it unfortunate that we didn't have an opportunity to learn how the vectors themselves are made (or did I miss something?), but merely got them out of a can from Google.It took me a while to figure out that the homeworks are graded by an AI, not a TA, and that one can submit the homework assignments numerous times until getting the grade you want.  Given the large number of students enrolled, I can understand that hand grading would not be an option.  It would probably be helpful to explain this to newcomers like me.I liked the way the assignments are structured. the fill-in-the-blanks approach, followed by some sort of numerical unit test to let us know if our solution was correct is good pedagogy (androgogy?).  My only criticism is that sometimes the unit tests are not very sensitive to common coding errors.  But now I know that we always have the option of running our assignment through the autograder for more complete feedback.The autograder is often overly prescriptive.  For example, "Function 'np.sign or np.heaviside' not found in Code Cell UNQ_C17."  Python is a rich language and there are many ways to code C17 without using those particular functions.  The goal should be to get students to solve a problem creatively -- not to follow a particular path.I found the week 4 assignment a real bear -- too long (22 completion sections) in comparison with the others.  I'm sure it was difficult for whoever codes the autograder as well.  They need to do some more code checking.  In UNQ__C8 we were asked to use the pre-coded cosine_similarity function.  Initially this was returning the cosine difference, which is quite the opposite.  In the middle of last week, after I and others reported the error, it was corrected but this seems to have created a cascade of other errors.  For example, in cell UNQ_C9, We are toldExpected Output:[[9 9 9] [1 0 5] [2 0 1]] Which is wrong.  A look at the vectors is enough to see that  (2,0,1) is closest to (1,0,1) by cosine similarity.  I believe the autograder makes the same confusion.  I mention this not to criticize our hard-working programmer, who is otherwise doing an excellent job, but so that the errors get fixed ;-) (edited)

I've got strange feelings about this course. If we are talking about courses from deeplearning.ai, it all started with Tensorflow in Practice specialization. 

This course have should have 2 weeks or maybe one, because everything can be accomplished in a few days. 

It has very small amount of interesting content. 

It is repetitive (some parts of assignments are copied from Deep Learning specialization assignments).

The video lessons are strange - it seems that two instructors recorded same videos and only beginning and ending from Łukasz Kaiser's videos got to the course (which is not fair).

Some procedures don't have description for function's arguments. Some procedures don't have testing function - you don't know if it works or not.

This course should be a part of another course, because it doesn't seem as a complete course. It feels like it doesn't completed, like it is a draft for a full course. 

I believe that others courses from this specialization will be better. If you know Russian, I suggest you to take course about NLP on Stepik platform https://stepik.org/course/54098/syllabus. It is much better.

 I came in with high expectations based on prior experience taking Andrews Ng's Marchine Learning course and Deep Learning specialization. Unfortunately, this course did not come close to meeting my expectations. The quality of the lectures is generally rather poor. The only real purpose they serve is to introduce terminology so that the student can seek better lecture material elsewhere. Some of the assignments may be interesting to folks with no prior NLP experience, but most are pretty basic to call this an intermediate level course. I recommend that folks fast-forward through the course lectures and find much better material available on youtube. Overall, I am pretty disappointed...

Moreover I think the quality of the code could be better. I'm working through the Specialization because my employer paid it. I can not say, it's very motivating. Despite my negative review, I learned something from it.

It was the worst experience I have ever had.  It is just pain with no gain. The instructor was too young. The lectures were not explaining anything that was included in the labs. The course learning objectives were entirely different from the course itself. The course requires expertise in python that is not written anywhere. The lectures and Labs are in different dimensions.  Everything that you want to learn will be in assignments that will not be taught in course lectures. It means that all the burden will be on your shoulders. Lecture videos are just about the intro and expect everything as an expert to be done in the assignments. It seems that it's a blog instead of a taught course. It's better that we go and read the blog related to NLP. Labs are all useless. Some labs are having errors that waste too much time for students. Poor support.

There are some typos here and there (so the course might need some more polish on that end) but, apart from that, it's accessible and puts the focus on understanding the concepts rather on coding contrary to what I have read in another review.

You could follow the course even with no prior experience in Python.

If you take the course, don't skip the ungraded assignements, they are an integral part of it and provide more detailed explanations of what has been taught in the lecture videos.

Thanks to the team and good luck all.

A high quality course overall!  It helped me understand both theory and the programming mechanics of implementation.  The Jupyter notebook guidance was detailed and well-organized!

Enhancement opportunities:

I felt the PCA lectures and PCA function implementation were a bit muddled.  Consider illustrating the geometric intuition behind PCA:  when 2-D data points are projected onto a line, the "best" line maximizes variance along the line while minimizing the reconstruction error of the data points.

The final notebook assignment is long and contains a large number of function and global variables.  It is a lot to digest.  Maybe enhance it with a takeaway video that unlocks after the assignment is passed.  The video will visually recap what was accomplished by showing the start-to-end pipeline.

The course is a great value for the price!

Good overall, but there is room for improvement.  The video lectures can be improved upon -- many of these are essentially the lecturer reading over a high-level description of a given concept, as opposed to detailed explanations (e.g., SVD & PCA topic).  The unit tests for the assignments also need to be more robust and/or error messages generated by the auto-grader need to be more specific.  You should not routinely see cases where "All Tests Pass" for ALL cells in the assignment notebook and yet the auto-grader fails to assign credit for 1+ modules, forcing the student to trouble-shoot issues that were not caught by the unit tests and for which the auto-grader error logs are unavailable.

By far the worst course I have ever done. 

The 'lectures' are just a few minutes long and as expected are very thin. Moreover, the majority (yes > 50%) of the lectures are spent explaining basic linear algebra (much of which is high school level) and hardly any time is spent on NLP itself. Most of the core NLP concepts are barely mentioned and it is obvious that the labs were written by someone else than the person who wrote the lectures as terminology gaps / differences exist and as the content is very thin it's impossible to put two and two together.

The readings are simply annotation summaries of the already brief lectures. They add no value.

The labs do not support learning in anyway. They are simply a 'fill in the gaps' exercise where > 50% of this would simply be figuring out which variable you need to index inside a loop. It is a joke.

The only good aspect of this course is the slack community and is the only thing I can recommend.  If you can sign up for the trial for the course / specialization and participate in the slack community. Apart from that, the remainder of this course is a huge waste of time: you won't learn NLP here, you will simply have a guided python tour with NLP problems as content.

I came to this course motivated and excited. However, after having taken the machine learning specialization taught by Professor Andrew Ng, I was disappointed by the quality of this course. Not only does this course go too fast and doesn't explain the intuition and reason behind concepts, the labs are outdated and have terrible unit tests. I work by day and study by night, only to find a programming assignment (week 2) that has terrible unit tests. It tells you that 12 tests passed and 3 didn't. Why? Who the hell knows why? Which defeats the concept of a unit test. Then I found myself debugging the unit tests themselves to understand why the they fail. I mean, calculating the loglikelihood is straightforward, and yet, it said that the tests failed. Go figure!

I recently completed the course on Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces, and I found it to be highly informative and well-structured. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to key NLP concepts, including vector spaces and classification techniques.

The content is presented in a clear and organized manner, making complex topics accessible even for those who are relatively new to the field. The course includes practical examples and exercises that are useful for reinforcing the theoretical concepts discussed. I particularly appreciated the focus on hands-on applications and real-world scenarios, which helped bridge the gap between theory and practice.

One area for improvement would be the inclusion of more advanced topics or additional case studies to challenge learners and deepen their understanding. Additionally, some sections could benefit from more detailed explanations or supplementary resources to further clarify complex ideas.

Overall, this course is a valuable resource for anyone looking to build a solid foundation in NLP and vector space models. I would definitely recommend it to both beginners and those with some prior knowledge who wish to refresh and enhance their skills

I enjoyed the course very much! I would say, there is still some things to improve, like the treatment of the implementation of the hash-local search, or some typos here and there along the way in the notebooks. Another suggestion is to postpone the implementation of SGD until after you get some warm-up in numpy during week 2-3. All in all I quite enjoyed the approach to be able to build the tools myself with numpy. This way, it demystifies the use of pre-built packages and lets the learner indeed understand what is going on under the hood. Of course, there is always a trade-off between being precise and being easy to understand. I think nevertheless that this course is spon-on in this trade-off optimization task. ;)

This course also gives a glance of vector spaces and techniques to convert multidimensional data to lesser dimension data using approaches like PCA.

The teacher rigorously explains its content by putting you in a real situation and the key concepts are very well explained in clear the academic rigor is there now I can affirm without reserve that I understand very well several concepts which were strange for me thank you to coursera and deeplearning.ai

This course had helped me become familiar in natural language processing. Before taking the course, I feel that NLP is already like a plug-and-play thing due to deep learning. However, it had helped me understand the importance of preprocessing especially to get the right embedding. Additionally, it also help me understand a glimpse of doing sentiment analysis and Machine translation. Indeed, I still have many things to learn but this course is a great way to be introduced on the NLP.

Great intro to the world of NLP. For those with a background in python, linear algebra and statistics (my case) course will take significantly less time, as you can skip some of the videos and rush through easier notebooks.  Assignments will make sure you haven't overlooked parts you don't yet understand. In my opinion comments and hints sometimes lead by the hand a little bit too much, but maybe I'll change my mind when faced with assignments from next courses of the specialisation.

I had attempted other NLP coursse before attempting this course. I found this course is a good to people who are new to NLP or even new to machine language. The hand-on examples and assignments are the plus points of this course. Though  the coding the assignment may look like "fill in the blanks" sort of exercise,  I appreciate it since it helped me to understand the concepts. Planing to take up the next course in this series. Great instructors and program is well structured.

Amazing course overall, I have a few years of experience working as Data Scientist and still could get many valueble learnings from it. So whether  you are a beginner or someone with some experience I would recommend it. The material is great, the Notebooks used for coding are very well structured, the lessons are very focused - I recommending doing some searches on the side to make sure you grasp all the concepts properly. Also the Slack community is very supportive.

Andrew Ng and his colleagues have delivered another excellent course - these really set the standard for online courses on machine learning.

At first I thought the pace was too slow and boring. But week 4 made things totally worth it.

Having previously completed the Deep Learning Specialization, I came to this course with the intention of completing the whole NLP specialization, rather than because I was especially interested in the content of this first course from that specialization.

The Deep Learning Specialization sets a high standard of teaching quality and I have to say I found this course is not quite to the same standard. It's pretty good but not as good. The instructors are very knowledgeable, they make the effort to explain each topic clearly and they do a pretty good job of that.

What I felt could be improved is providing context of where each topic fits into the broader picture of both the theory and current practice of NLP. I was often left feeling, why are we spending time on this particular topic? Is this technique used in current practice or is it just of didactic or historical interest? Great teachers always have the broader context in mind and make sure that students see how everything fits into the bigger picture and why it is worth studying.

Although techniques were clearly explained, I felt that the underlying concepts were sometimes less well explained. An example is vector representations of words: we were shown the use of vector arithmetic to find analogies, but without much in the way of explanation of how this is possible. To me, this was the wrong way around: it makes more sense to me to first build an understanding of the representations, then introduce the remarkable result that these representations allow finding analogies.

In this course, sentences are represented as a "bag of words". This is processing natural language in the way a food processor processes food: chopping it up into a word soup. Since one of the most fundamental aspects of language is its structure, this might seem a hopeless approach. However it gives surprisingly good results for some simple tasks such as classifying tweets as having positive or negative sentiment. If you've done course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization (Sequence Models), this will feel like a step backwards. There's no deep learning in this course. But I signed up for the course knowing that, so I can't criticise it on that basis. I'm taking the view that this course lays the foundations for more advanced and current topics in the subsequent courses in the specialization and I look forward to getting onto those.

The labs and assignments generally work smoothly. There are a few inconsistencies and a couple of the hints were a bit misleading but generally OK. It's a bit paint-by-numbers though, filling in bits of code within functions rather than working out for yourself how to structure the code.

This "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces" course covers:
- Logistic regression
- Laplacian smoothing, log likelihood, naive bayes models to predict sentiment of tweets
- Euclidean distance, cosine similarity between word vectors to understand relationship between sets of text, and Principal Component Analysis
- Language translation using rotation matrices, k-nearest neighbours and locality sensitive hashing

The course has weekly lecture videos and has a summary reading after almost every video, which was especially helpful when trying to understand the concepts discussed in a video as a whole.

There are also shorter labs to familiarise you with NLP concepts before the weekly graded programming assignment.

Be sure to walk through and understand how the functions in utils_%.py accompanying each lab work. Similarly, walk through the functions in utils_%.py and how unit test cases are prepared in unittest.py accompanying each assignment.

A good part of this course has been that the course team periodically releases new versions of the labs and assignments containing fixes or new approaches. Therefore bugs discovered by users in your assignment 3 months ago could already be fixed by the time you work on your assignment.

The downside to the course is that the discussion forums were not actively monitored. Therefore there are some questions I have on certain concepts which were not answered by the time I completed the course.

I'm a master/graduate student who took an NLP course in Uni. 

I think that overall this is a very a good introduction to the topic. Some concepts are really well explained - in a simple manner and with a lot of jupyter-lab code to experiment with.

In general in this specialization - the first 3 courses are good. There are some quirks (e.g. why Lukas is needed at all? He doesn't really teaches, just passes it on to Younes) but nevertheless I learned from it. And I think they have good value in them.

The 4th one, however, is completely disappointing. First 2 "weeks" are confusing, not really well explained, but somewhat "bearable". The last 2 weeks are complete sham. They claim to teach "BERT" and "T5" but don't really give any value. You're better off going elsewhere to learn these concepts.

If it wasn't for this, I would give the overall experience a 5 stars, but because of this, I think the overall is more like 3 or 4.

The courses  have really enlightened me on NLP. I had no idea about the techniques. I'll give it 4 stars, because the course instructors have a monotonicity of lecturing as if reading from a teleprompter with a fake synthetic voice. It sometimes gives me a headache and I end up muting the videos and just reading the subtitles (which a lot of times don't make sense and are short paces so I have to freeze the screen, and open 2 other windows and read the lower caption text). I have been doing many courses on this platforms, and even though the instructors are on the top of their fields, but the way they deliver the courses is just "sometimes" and "not always" painful. I am sure this is not how they teach there own classes, especially in Stanford. Even though the course is 50$ per month, a think it won't cost the instructors much to show some authentic enthusiasm.

Took me roughly 5 days to finish this course. The course is of high quality. The instructors had done a great job preparing for the materials in this course. The videos are short and concise, and they focus more on intuition instead of mathematic details, which is great for beginners. 

However, I would say the coding portion in this course is pretty limited. We did not get to write a lot of codes as most of the frameworks and functions had been implemented for us. What we need to do was simply filling in the blanks (and the comments will reveal the answers, making it even much easier). I also feel that some helper functions should not be provided. I think the course will be better if we get to write codes for labs also. Nevertheless, the course is open to the general public so I think this design is rational.

The course is interesting because it takes a look at NLP processing from a different view than just deep learning or word-in-bag type analysis. Most concepts are clearly explained, allowing most anyone with some python language experience to make it through the course. The programming assignments are similar to other courses. That is.... the assignments can be frustrating because you are trying to fill in the blanks through someone else's style of coding, but satisfying when the assignment is completed. I imagine that a few more iterations of the developing the course material and this will be another 5star course for the deeplearning.ai organization.

Every component was really informative to me. Besides, the mentors were always helpful and gave quick responses to my questions posed in the community forum. I was satisfied with most of the contents, because I got familiar with the vector representation of texts. However, the details of creating word embeddings were not described here in this specialization (maybe in another specialization such as NLP with Attention model). I want to know more about Google's BERT model, so I will take another course in the near future. Anyway, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the teachers and mentors of this specialization!

The course is a great introduction to NLP where various techniques and algorithms were explained clearly either through videos or notebooks. I'm giving 4 stars as some question in the quizzes had a bad formatting or couldn't submit the correct (answers are straightforward but still gives wrong answer as a non numerical entry). Another negative comment about some questions for example: can we use Kmeans to reduce the time of searching? and Kmeans was a wrong answer, though intuitavely it can be used as well. All in all, the course was great and I glad I took it.

This is a good intro-level NLP course. I don't regret taking it. I guess I just expected something a bit more challenging from Andrew Ng. Personally, I liked the assignments but I would like to see more materials (videos/readings) about the mathematical underpinnings of these methods. Then again, there are three more courses to go and something tells me, things will pick up. At the end of the day, the authors made the course very accessible to a broad audience. And if I really want more math, I suppose I can always read the original papers :)

This is an excellently crafted course for students with previous experience in machine learning and python programming. The lab notebooks during the course help to solidify your understanding of the concepts and lets you play around in your own curiosity. However, I do think the assignments could be made more difficult to allow students to practice programming better (as it currently stands, you sometimes feel like the solution is being spoon-fed to you). Kudos to the team!

The course is well crafted and the instructors are also good at teaching. I did face some issues though:
1) Lack of responses when questions were raised in the community forum . 

2) The third week seems too condensed and difficult to understand as compared to others . A lot of new topics were referenced without proper clarification around them which made the entire topic seem rushed leaving the learner to only come up with basic code and depriving them of an intuition .

Course is interesting. I have learned many new concepts. However, as a beginner to NLP the lecturers are too short. Explanations about certain methodologies are not sufficient. Many a times, I need to refer other articles to understand the concepts. Assignments are simple. Most of the times the descriptions given in the assignment are enough to code it. However, as we have to code only few lines, I did not get the feel of implementing the whole concepts.

The course is very well designed. It gives the reader a taste of both, mathematics and coding, to make them it easier for them to understand the concepts. Although, these concepts cannot be learned in one go, still this is a good attempt by tutors to make things clear as well as possible. I recommend this course to someone who has a little idea about NLP, not to someone who hasn't heard the term NLP ever in life..

Very good theoretical introduction to NLP and some classical methods to perform simple supervised and unsupervised classification tasks.

Very nice programming exercises. The grader is quite strict regarding the choice of numpy functions: e.g. array.reshape(-1) is just as good as array.squeeze() but was counted as wrong; v * v is just as good as np.square(v) and was counted as wrong. As a statistician, I also found confusing that you talk about likelihoods but actually you mean likelihood ratios (Bayes factors).

Very basic stuff although good for beginners for building the foundation. Programming assignments can be improved further. One is expected to guess and use some pre-defined functions like np.vstack.

It's really hard to rate this course.

Pros:

- I think the coverage of the material in the lectures is excellent, and it does a good job of simply explaining some pretty complex topics. 

- The instructors did a good job of pulling together real-word-relevant examples of applications, which made me feel more motivated to continue working on the material.

- The pacing is fast, but I didn't feel overwhelmed.

- There are nice visualizations

- The instructors are really friendly and enthusiastic.

Cons (serious, nearly crippling cons):

- The autograding tests are broken on at least one lesson, meaning that even someone who meets the specifications may lose points. Nobody seems to be in a hurry to fix these problems.

- The quality of the code is frequently ATROCIOUS. Whoever wrote the code failed to understand basic things like the fact that search time in dictionaries is O(1) and you don't need to use the keys() method to iterate through a dictionary. It's not all bad- there is plenty of reasonably well-written code in the course, as well as code that looks wonky but isn't really that bad. But there's also a lot of code that is very poorly written and inefficient.

- There's also a lack of consistent style in the code, which isn't wrong per se, but really makes the content harder to read. In particular, there should be no "'string1'+str(x) + 'string2'" syntax, which is a bad habit that I had to break a while back. f-strings are the way to go.

- To conclude, this is as SERIOUS PROBLEM because some students will be learning "good coding practices" from this course and others like it, and if they learn about some of the relevant Python libraries from this course, they may learn terrible habits from this course.

It's clear that the creators of this course could not decide who it was going to be aimed at, or what level it would be. So, you end up with a course that is too light on the NLP but assumes anyone doing the assignments knows the little numpy and dictionary tricks that they do. Consequently, the assignments do not test your understanding of NLP, only your understanding of how the notebook creators code. 

The videos are far too short, a common complaint I can see from other reviews. Additionally, they fell into a common trap that plagues script writing for education. What you absolutely must not do, and is exactly what they do, is just machine gun through the information and terminology when presenting. If you watch good lecturers, they leave time for concepts to settle in and they will reinforce key points by restating them in a different way. They know how to hit the beats because they know how people learn. An information dump, as we have here, is a poor didactic method.

The assignments are mostly okay and use notebooks where you have to 'fill in the blanks'. There are some flaws with this, the first being that you have to write the code in the format they want, so alternative methods are marked as wrong. Even more severe is that there are insufficient checks in some of the later notebooks. It is possible to get far into one and obtain the expected results, only to have one cell give the wrong result. This means the error is in an earlier cell and you have no way of knowing where it is without spending a long time exploring. This problem is especially bad in the final week's assignment, which is overly long and has an insufficient number of checks.

This course has a lot of promise as an introduction to NLP methods. It does a clear job of introducing logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and basic concepts of embeddings. However, I have some significant reservations about the current state of the course.

First, the course is introduced by Andrew Ng as being taught by Younes Bensouda Mourri and Lukasz Kaiser, and heavily promoted by Andrew's marketing through deeplearning.ai and The Batch. In reality, Andrew is barely involved (except for a couple of excellent optional interviews), Lukasz says a sentence or two at the beginning of each lecture, and Younes handles the lectures. Younes is just fine as a teacher, but it is clear he is reading from scripts and one feels as if the course was advertised as being taught by a more senior team. It does not have anything like the feel of authority of Andrew's classic Machine Learning course on Coursera.

Second, there are various small errors in the materials. For example, one slide set that has numerous calculations wrong because a column of numbers is summed to 12 rather than 13, and the course has a small notice about the error rather than correcting the slides. There are various confusing instructions (and some small errors) in the programming assignments.

Third, some of the choices of content were odd. I did not understand why week 3 spent much of the programming assignment on the details of implementation of PCA (which is a visualization technique not an NLP technique), without really teaching the underlying math.

In sum, this is a good introduction to NLP concepts but as yet below the standard that one expects in the Andrew Ng universe.

There is room for improvment in this module.

Please find below, some comments that may help improving the content:

1. I found that there is a lack of hindsight on the place of these methods in NLP processing chains and how they are combined.
2. Errors are present in the slides and should be corrected in the content as well (especially in week 2 Vclass vs V + incorrect addition of frequencies which made several slides inacurate).
3. Using the term "dot products" limits the understanding of the transformations performed in vector space. In my opinion, it would be worthly to speak/ write "projection" instead on the slides.

4. Make a clear plan within a week that recall the place of each concept into NLP processing. It will give a better insight of the importance and the place of each concept by looking to the utlimate goal of producing an NLP processing chain.
5. Make a better disctinction between sentences (tweet) and document.

6. the content is, in my opinion, too fragmented

The notebooks are regular, some cells marked as "hint" and those contains info about functions required to pass tests when I submit the notebook. In the other hand, some functions are equivalent, for example np.dot is equivalent to dot function for a numpy array instance. However, some tests evaluate if cells contains np.dot even when the output is correct. This is so confusing and I spend a lot of time checking my cells when even the output is correct.  Concluding, the notebooks can be better, instead of say "print the variable x to know about the structure" you can use visual aids to show what we are doing, I'm lit tired of checking my variables, check the structure and check and check every cell. Another advice, please stop of using list, set and np arrays together without any mean, I mean just use dictionaries and np arrays and this is all! I'll qualify this as 3 stars because the notebooks. I learned about and thanks teachers.

The video explanations are too mathematical, and maybe a bit short, as they are complex information that could be explained further.

I think the final test after the week's videos was a good idea, and I missed it here.

The "intermediate" code "assignments" should also ask you to code stuff, not just read what other person has coded, in my opinion.

Finally, I think the final programming assignments are not very well explained (especially compared to those of the Deep Learning Specialization), I was very lost most of the time and didn't really know what I was doing beyond applying some math. Actually, for the last assignment, which was supposed to be a translation from English to French, I didn't see it at any point at all. I basically don't know what I coded there.

The course is clear, understandable for people have basic ML background. It's very practical too. Never get bored. 

I'd give 3 star as I think the grading system for assignment should be better. For example, when it's grading KNN, it requires the output cluster element is following an exact order, so you won't get the point if the output cluster(as a list) in a different order, even though it outputs the same cluster of element, which makes little sense. Funny thing is the grading standard for KNN requires the order of cluster element following distance from largest to smallest, not the other way around. Meanwhile, I did suspect some of the assignment answers were incorrect. However, no one has replied for my post in the forum.

It looks like first scetch of the course. All programming assignments has "try your own examples, check what you just implemented". Week 4 translation - after performing gradient decent I didn't have oportunity to test translation. Or the buggy example with Country Capital matching "if you use euclidian distance Ankara is capital of Japen".
After Deep Learning specialization where Andrew Ng so passionately explain you everything, guys that are reading from a teleprompter  looks boring and unprofessional. Like "if you can't explain it in YOUR OWN words you don't understand it."

But Labs were useful and hints sometime too.  That is good. I guess most of the topics were covered, thanks for that.

I had a problem with the grading for assignment 4 in course 1 and after quite a bit of troubleshooting and posting a forum question I found a similar problem that had a suggestion that helped me fix it.  I would have liked to be able to get some feedback from an instructor directly to save 2-3 days of struggling to resolve the grading glitch myself.

With respect to a first course in NLP this it is ok but as others have said most of the code is already written.   If you are wanting to understand the intuition of NLP this can be good but then difficult to apply yourself in practice.

if you compare this course to that taught by Andrew directly, this course is somewhat lacking. I love how Andrew teaches his students (like he did in ML course and DL Specialization) using direct writing on the screen and using natural speaking rather than speaking like a robot (yeah you just read texts when explaining something).

Many mathematical concepts but lacking explanations.

You placed too many coding assistants in the programming assignments, making doing the assignments is just like a fill-in-the-blank question. not challenging.

Some videos could be better presented. For instance, start explaining that k-NN will not be implemented the usual way, but using a fast approach.

Also, the validation of the submissions could do better. np.array(list) works just like np.stackv(list). del(foo[bar]) works just like foo.remove(bar) and matrix.squeeze() works just like np.squeeze(matrix).

I know it is difficult to get all the possible code combinations. But probably the code could be tested more as input/output than grepping the code for keywords.

I must admit that I am quite disappointed with this course. The explained material was interesting, but there were many errors in the assignments.

Hence you must do exercises exactly as the professors wanted, even if there are other approaches.

This class is disappointing, especially after the Machine Learning Specialization classes which were given by Andrew Ng.  Overall, this is the kind of class where the detailed syllabus the most valuable component.  There is good information and topical introductions here, but I think the lecturer has forgotten the feeling of not being 1000% familiar with the material, especially the math.

Some notes:

1)  Most, if not all topics are glossed over very quickly, especially mathematical ones.  I very much miss Andrew's deeper (and more extensive) "intuition" videos here, and I say that as someone with a degree in computer science.

2) There are many errors in the lectures and in the labs.  Sometimes a "popup" will tell you about them, sometimes not.

3) Popup quizzes in the lecture videos happen before the lecturer has even finished speaking about the topic being quizzed and are very jarring.

4) The "practice" (but still graded) quizzes have a difficulty level way out of proportion to the lecture content, especially those mathematical concepts that are so quickly glossed over.  If you really must spend only 30 seconds on an equation and then expect us to remember/work it off the top of our head in a quiz days later, give us some exercises or some practice at least!

5) Labs are mostly just literal steps of "type this", "now type this".  When it is more demanding, the instructions are not very useful and do not prepare anyone for the quirks of how libraries like numpy work.  In many cases, there is no way to explain or diagnose why my numerical outputs were different from expected, especially when I followed all the instructions.  Having to deep dive into the numpy documentation to find arbitrary arguments based on (seemingly arbitrary) data structure choices of the lab author in order to complete a lab doesn't feel productive or motivating.

6) Although a minor nit, the audio inconsistency between talking head and slides is very jarring.  Compare to any of Andrew Ng's videos!

I believe the course does not allow you to study NLP in depth. Compared to the deep learning specialisation by deeplearning.ai, this course has probably hours(!) of video material less. PCA is for instance presented in ~4 minutes and the lecturer concludes with "now that you know all about PCA". The only further reference provided is a link to the standard textbook in the field, no detailed study guide or references for individual topics. Excercises are done in notebooks and test beginner python skills instead of nlp understanding (Basically: "Look up key i in dictionary j and store vector k"). It does do a good job in giving an overview about NLP.

I was torn between two and three stars. Two, as mathematics are dealt with far to shallow. No proofs, no motivation, nothing. And in the final week, there is a massive notebooks with a lot of flaws and a lot of cells you have to code in a specific, sometime suboptimal, way. Otherwise, the grader will throw errors. All in all, things are handled to shallow and it is more of a coding lesson than a deep dive into ML, which necessarily requires mathematics. This is one more of those "Become a data scientist without mathematics" things the world does not need.

lectures are pretty mediocure. basically it lacks motivation behind algorithms, you are simply told what to do, really like "machine" learning

you'll spend a lot of time in the assignment, not focusing on implementing your algorithm, but adjusting incorrect input or output format that passes all tests but fail the final grading for some reason (also in week 3 the assignment has one or two questions that do not even tell you what's the input data and you have to "print" them to get an idea lol)

The lectures skip over important features that should be explained in more detail. Other important concepts are left to the labs, even if those require a good explanation. Evaluations are not a help to practice or understand concepts. Most of the time spent on evaluations is figuring out how to do things in Python rather than follow the concepts. People can obtain 100% in the evaluations but learn nothing. It is indeed a very poor course.

Rather shallow and elementary course, I am disappointed. I did the deep learning specialization so I expected the same quality level here, but no it's not the case. In a way you're exploiting the fame of Andrew Ng to attract students, but Andrew is not teaching here and you're offering a content that is not up to expectations. I will try the following course and hopefully it will be more interesting.

The course covers some basic aspects of Natural Language Processing and can serve as an introduction to NLP, but it definitely not an in-depth course. The assignments are just some Python scripts where you have to fill in the gaps, which is not a helpful learning strategy, since you aren't given the opportunity to try things out by yourself and figure out what works.

There are too many errors in this course. The lecturing is uninspired. The assignments are boring and weak.

Subject: Refund Request for NLP Course

Dear Coursera Support Team,

I recently enrolled in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course on Coursera. However, I was not informed that passing an exam would be required to complete the course. I found the course content to be too difficult and was unable to complete it successfully. Given these circumstances, I would like to request a refund for the amount paid.

When I registered, I was under the impression that the course would be more accessible, and I did not receive any clear communication regarding the mandatory exam. Since I was unable to finish the course and benefit from it, I kindly request that my payment be refunded.

Additionally, I would appreciate any further details on the refund process. Please let me know if there are any necessary steps I need to take. My contact number is 7981360231, and you can also reach out to Jajam Teju regarding this matter.

I understand that Coursera has specific refund policies, and I appreciate your time in reviewing my request. I hope for a positive resolution and look forward to your response at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your support.

Terribly frustrating experience so far.  

I have a phd in a statistical field and many years of experience with machine learning.  I took this course to brush up on things I already know, as well as learn some new aspects of NLP.

So far, on courses where the content is a breeze for me, I spend more time trying to get the stupid tests to work than I do answering the questions.  Then when my functions pass the tests, the autograder says they fail, and there's no clear explanation for why.  The autograder says "see stderr output" but it's not provided!  If you so much as breathe the wrong way in the code the autograder will fail.

Then you try to get help and the Coursera documentation says "go ask someone in the forums."  Yet you can't find the forums because the link to the forums is not in the place where the documentation says it should be.

I cannot express how badly the material was presented. They are just reading mechanically and gesturing very artificially. It is stressful to follow such videos which lack any natural expression.

Moreover, many terms and ideas are hushed through and are difficult to understand.  What a pity!
