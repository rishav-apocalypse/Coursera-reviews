He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 for illuminating the human conscience in the face of absurdity. His later works, including The Plague (1947) and The Fall(1956), explored themes of suffering, justice, and human solidarity. Tragically, Camus died in a car accident on January 4, 1960, at the age of 46, cutting short a career that had significantly influenced modern thought.
